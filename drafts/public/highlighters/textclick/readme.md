Each folder contains the same text highlighter question, but is set for a better and separate version control. Logic is as follows: 

	v1 - Major change - Increases on how the question works or when a new feature is added
	.0 - question settings - Increases when there was a change related to the question settings i.e. client getting a new colour selector for an element
	.0 - respondent version - Increase upon changes that affect the respondent's perception on the question
